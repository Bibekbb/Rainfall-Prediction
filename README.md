# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction

A machine learning project for predicting rainfall using meteorological data and various predictive models.

## ✨ Key Features (Suggested)
- Time series analysis of historical rainfall data
- Multiple ML model implementations (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, etc.)
- Data preprocessing pipeline for weather data
- Visualization of prediction results
- Model performance comparison

## 🛠️ Technologies (Commonly Used)
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning models

## 📊 Dataset
Typically includes: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed/Direction, Historical Rainfall
