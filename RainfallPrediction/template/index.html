    <h2>About Rainfall Prediction</h2>
    <p class="about-content" style="text-align: justify;">
      Rainfall Prediction is an innovative web application that utilizes machine learning to forecast rainfall for the
      following day. By analyzing historical weather patterns from the Rain Prediction in Australia dataset, this
      project aims to provide users with accurate and timely weather predictions. You can access the project's code in
      my <a href="https://github.com/Bibekbb" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">GitHub repository</a>.

      Australia is known for its diverse and often unpredictable climate. This app addresses the need for reliable
      rainfall forecasts, particularly in regions where annual precipitation is scarce. With more than 80% of Australia
      receiving less than 600 mm of rain each year, understanding local weather patterns is crucial for agriculture,
      water management, and disaster preparedness.

      The southern parts of the country experience unique weather phenomena, including the influence of westerly winds
      and cold fronts during winter, while the northern regions are marked by a distinct wet season characterized by
      heavy monsoonal rains. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, Rainfall Prediction not only predicts the
      likelihood of rain but also educates users about the factors that contribute to Australia's complex weather
      systems.

      Join me on this journey to better understand and anticipate rainfall, making informed decisions for both daily
      activities and long-term planning. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
